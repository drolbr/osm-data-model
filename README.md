# OSM Data Model

The OSM Data Model determines how our data is structured in the OSM database.
In general it is working well for us, but it has its problems. We have changed
it in the past and we can change it again, if we find better ways of doing
things.

This repository documents what we have and where problems are and here
discussions can take place to see how we can evolve the data model into
something better suited for the future of OSM.
